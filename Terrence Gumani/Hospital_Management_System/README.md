Hospital Management System (HMS)

System Overview
The HMS is designed to manage various hospital operations efficiently. It should handle
patient data, staff management, appointment scheduling, and medical records.
Key Requirements
Patient Management
1. Register new patients with details like name, age, address, and medical history.

2. Search for existing patients by name or ID.

3. Update patient information.


Appointment Scheduling
1. Schedule new appointments with doctors.
2. Cancel or reschedule existing appointments.
3. View upcoming appointments for a patient.


Staff Management
1. Add new staff members with details like name, role, department.
2. Assign doctors to specific departments.


Medical Records Management
1. Record and retrieve patient medical histories.
2. Manage prescription information.


User Authentication
1. Secure login for hospital staff.
2. Different access levels based on roles (e.g., doctors, nurses, administrative staff).


Reporting
1. Generate various reports (e.g., daily appointments, monthly billing summaries).
2. Export reports (you can just print to console).


Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Start by designing the base classes and interfaces, keeping in mind the SOLID
principles.
2. Develop each module (Patients, Appointments, Staff, Medical Records, Billing,
Authentication, Reporting) separately, then integrate them.
3. Use design patterns judiciously where they fit naturally.
4. Write clean, readable code, and comment on complex logic.

Project Implementation Stages
Stage 1: Design and Planning
Analyze requirements and plan the overall architecture.
Create class diagrams and outline the relationships between different entities.
Stage 2: Core Implementation
Implement the base classes and essential modules.
Focus on achieving functional requirements with clean and efficient code.
Stage 3: Integration and Testing
Integrate different modules and ensure they work together seamlessly.
Conduct thorough testing with different use cases to catch and fix bugs.
