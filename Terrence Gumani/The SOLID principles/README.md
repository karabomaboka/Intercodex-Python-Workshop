The SOLID Principle;

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change.
It should have only one responsibility or job.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
You should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its source code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
